 Notes on the project:  
I made the mistake of designing this desktop-first instead of mobile-first, using Tailwind. Lesson learnt. I had some difficulties making the cards completely responsive, and found that my Tailwind classNames were becoming a bit excessive trying to account for various screen sizes and there are some issues with the display. This might be easier to resolve if I redid the Tailwind starting mobile-first. I plan on trying a different CSS framework for my next project to see if there is something that will produce cleaner-looking code (not sure I like the inline classNames when they become extremely long as it starts to look quite messy).
